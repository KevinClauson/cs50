0.  Longest word in the dictionary.
1.  getrusage returns information describing the resources utilized by the current process.
2.  16
3.  They are both structs so easier to pass pointer to struct then the whole struct.  
4.  The for loop keeps going until it get to the end of file.  It starts by getting a char that it converts to an int.  
    We then check to see if that char was a letter with alpha or an apostrophes and if it is an apostrophe we also check if the index 
    is greater than 0 because we want to make sure apostrophe is not the first char.  
    If the length of the word we are building becomes bigger than the longest word in the dictionary, then we use a while loop to 
    skip over the rest of the word and move on by returning the index to 0. If we run into a number then we also skip over and set
    the index back to 0 we keep skiping over numbers until we run into another letter or end of file. If the current char is not a
    letter or number or apostrophe then we set the last elemeent of the word array as a null to complete the string and count increment
    the word variable by one.  Then we check if the word is in the dictionary.  If not we print it and increment the misspellings 
    variable by one.  
5.  Using fscanf() you might take in words that are not words, for example words that have numbers in them or things that are not 
    letters.  By going a char at a time we can make checks for various things to weed out things that are not words.  
6.  We do not want to modify those words so we declare them as constants.
